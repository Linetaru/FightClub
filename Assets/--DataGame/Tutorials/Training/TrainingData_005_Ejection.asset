  textboxStart:
  - Like I said before, in the Brawler competition your goal is to eject your opponents
    out of the fighting area.
  - Stretching time is over, let's try to eject your opponent out of the floor !
  textboxEnd:
  - 'nice combo ! In a really competition you will need to eject your opponent form
    the side or the top until his has no stocks left. '
  - You can see how many stocks your apponent still have by looking at his IU. You
    see ? His stock are the tiny icons below the gauge.
  - in others terms, when you have no stock anymore it's your last chance to win
    !

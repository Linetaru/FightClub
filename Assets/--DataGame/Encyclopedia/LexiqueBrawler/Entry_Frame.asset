  entryText: 'A frame is a timescale often used in video games. We speak of frame
    per second (FPS) to indicate the number of frames that passes in a second. Therefore,
    being in 60 FPS, a frame represents 1/60 seconds.


    This term is often employed
    in fighting games, especially to talk about attacks. An attack lasting 12 frames
    is an attack lasting 12/60, or 0.2 seconds.'

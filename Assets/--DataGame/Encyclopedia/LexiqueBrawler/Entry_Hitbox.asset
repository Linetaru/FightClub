  entryText: 'The Hitbox is the tangible area of a character. If an attack touches
    this tangible area, the character will take damages.


    It often happens that
    a gap is visible between the visual representation of the character and its hitbox
    for performance and balancing issues.


    That is why in some cases, the character
    takes damages even though visually, it was not touched by the attack.'

  entryText: "A buffer is the fact of keeping an input in memory, therefore keeping
    in memory the push of the key.\n\nA buffer input has a size, representing a timeframe
    during which the pressure of the key is kept in memory. A buffer input of 3 frames,
    means that an action is kept i memory during 0.05 seconds.\nWhen a character
    executes an action and you press the attack key to combo, it is possible that
    you press it too soon even though the character did not finish his action. \n\nThanks
    to the buffer input, this press will be saved a short time. As soon as the character
    finishes his first action, the game looks into the buffer input to see if an
    action is stocked. If there is one, the character directly executes it.\n\nThe
    buffer input reduces the level of precision needed for certain timings, it improves
    the player's experience.\n"

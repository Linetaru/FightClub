  entryText: "The Directional Influence, is the action of leaning the stick in a
    direction at the moment you get hit by an attack.\n\nThis results in a change
    of the ejection trajectory from the received attack. \nFor example when receiving
    a hit that ejects to the right, if your stick is leaning towards the top, the
    trajectory will be slightly modified to a top-right diagonal instead of the right.
    That is called the Directional Influence, aka DI.\n"

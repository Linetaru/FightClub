    It feels great to have composed the
    soundtracks of the game. At the begining, I never thought to make some Drum &
    Bass for it, but because it was suggested by some members of the team, I went
    for it to see how it would works with the gameplay. The futuristic story and
    the visual of Break Punch gave me some inspiration and of course the support
    from the team contributed a lot to it. I hope you enjoy the music but first and
    foremost playing our game! Have fun !
